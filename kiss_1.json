      "abstract": "The study investigates the ordinary repertory of liturgical sources from Aquileia and Cividale, highlighting the significant German-Central European influence on their melodies. Through comparative analysis, it identifies distinct regional characteristics and orientations, contrasting them with other Italian and European sources. Despite methodological challenges and limitations in data reliability, the research underscores the intercultural nature of the Aquileian tradition and suggests further exploration of its unique liturgical identity.",

Is Tannabaur or not?",

In any case, the majority of these extra melodies give evidence of the above-mentioned German orientation as well. Perhaps the most notable observation is that the German Ostländisch or Ostfrankisch, I would say, orientation reveals itself on a more general level than that of the inner differentiation of the diocese. Such melodies prevail not only in the common stock of melodies, but among the local ones too. So in the melodies. Melodies were in Europe. They were used either only in Aquileia or only in Cividale. Formulated in another way, the source groups of Aquileia, in the narrow sense, and Cividale reveal a German-Central European orientation also independently of each other. It is frequently emphasized in the literature that besides indications of a connection between Aquileia and the neighboring Italian regions, the influence of the northern areas can be strongly felt. This may be attributed to several factors, the listing of which would exceed the limits of this paper. Suffice it to mention the intercultural position of this area, the fact that between the 11th and 13th centuries all patriarchs were of German origin or the influence of the Italian monasteries founded from here-so, etc. The many experiences referring to this influence served as a basis for the views of the local people, that research should concentrate on an identification of evidence of this German influence rather than the definition of an independent and, to a certain extent, imaginary Aquileian liturgy. In any case, an examination of the ordinary repertory of Aquileia coincides with these observations.",

        "text": "Actually, at least on the basis of my experiences in the Kyrielle repertory, there is no reason not to designate similarly the other sources from Aquileia and Cividale used in the catalogues. Moreover, it is the source from San Marco mentioned above, the labelling of which might raise doubts. The claim arises naturally that we should check the former observations by comparing the Aquileian sources with carefully selected Italian sources from the neighbouring or possibly more remote regions. For this reason, I have made further analysis in the following source group, see example 6. The first of the two subgroups, which I separated in the following, in the following comparative tables too, contains north Italian, while the other has rather central Italian sources. Of course, in the arbitrariness, or one might say haphazardness in the selection of sources, a certain danger is concealed. Nevertheless, on the basis of a relatively large number of instances, the characteristic points reveal themselves and confirm the relative independence of the source group. Some of these characteristic points connect to a wide circle of Italian sources to each other, while others serve as a basis for further differentiation. And what is more important, the similarities and differences can be interpreted along the same trends as those we established in the Aquileian repertory, that is, the somewhat abstract, and hypothetical methodological categories concerning the orientation of sources prove to be useful here as well. In the comparative tables, I use the same methods for the differentiation of the Einzelmelodien, the Italian, the German or French Italian-oriented melodies, see example 7.",

The one exception is the Kyrie melody number 31, which besides the source from San Marco can also be documented from Monza, Benevent, Monte Cassino and Nursia as well. The number of the so-called German-oriented melodies is remarkably less than was in Aquileia. This is more significant in the light of the dissemination, since here such melodies occur sporadically here and there. An exception is the Gloria 19, which on the other hand is missing from Aquileian sources, though this is also a German-oriented melody, well-known in Europe. The high number of melodies hypothetically called West Frankish is completely in harmony with this observation. Although some of them can be documented from one or a few sources, which may be a consequence of the random selection of the sources, others show themselves significantly characteristic of the non-Aquileian Italian codices. I have marked them with an asterisk in the third row of example 8. I have marked them with an asterisk in the third row of example 8.",

And the evaluation of the sources requires several aspects other than the mere occurrence or absence of a certain melody. For example, my own research proved that distribution of the Curiale melodies in the sources, the assignment of them to certain feasts, the pairing of them, the compilation of cycles from them, and, last but not least, the actual variance of the melodies, all together outline a physiognomy of repertory that could be characteristic of a diocese or a consuetudo.",

As Camillo Oswald, among others, emphasizes, there is a not negligible difference between the 12th and 15th century state of the Aquileian tradition. Among my observations there may be cases where the differences are the consequences of chronological rather than geographical or institutional distance of the sources. However, the variables presented in the foregoing reveal the character of the Aquileian ordinary repertory, show its significant points, and are quite promising as to make the picture more accurate and convincing later on by examining the other aspects mentioned above. Thank you very much.",

I mean, we have really to divide it up, and as soon as we begin to draw consequences of such groupings, I think we really have to make sure what is the basic material on which we work. So to add another small remark to it, I mean, if we, it's like hardware space, as soon as you begin to take the whole transmission into account, first assumptions and consequences that you draw from looking to one or two or three sources become relative. Of course, this is the same picture if you work on certain pieces and pieces of the work. Of course, the tropes of ordinary pieces have to be taken into account, and you just speak about an Italian situation which shows up outside from Bacchilea with interesting but very specific selection of sources. As soon as you fill up the picture, more and more and more, and there, of course, is an enormous amount of manuscript.

it could be interpreted with difficulty that the actually recorded ordinary repertory of sources belonging to the same tradition and being almost identical concerning their liturgical stock may differ so much in their content and quantity however my own comparative research in the field confirms the experience formulated partly by others as well that a rich enough material and interpretation differentiated properly offer significant points that can be usefully supplement the experience gained in other laboratories and may contribute to the the , the definition of the character of a source group for this reason I undertake now to give an overall picture of a special repertory the ordinary repertory in a special source group the sources from Aquileia and Cividale aiming at fitting the conference theme I do this despite that in the collection of the information I was compelled to accept compromises since few sources were very available and microfilm I decided to supplement my data bank with information gathered from the published ordinary catalogues since it is well known that these are by no means correct in every respect my collected information and the conclusion based on it must be considered cautiously it is also known that these catalogues are not suitable for the examination of several aspects thus I have only the possibility of using the data that is available on microfilm I decided to supplement my data bank with the data that is available on microfilm I decided to supplement my data bank conclusions beyond the occurrence and or absence of certain melodies only where these seem to be sufficiently convincing though experimental in nature the following overview supplements usefully and harmonizes well with our knowledge about the consuetude of Aquileiaensis for a survey of the ordinary repertory of Aquileia I used a coherent source group which can be seen in your handout and example one after cataloging all ordinary melodies in them I analyzed what kind of melodies the repertories are compiled from and how they can be grouped which melodies are Einzelmelodien if there are any examples at all and which appear more frequently in the sources the latter requires further differentiation for it is by no means indifferent what broad dissemination the information referred to behind the individual melodies belonging to this group the appearance of the general European repertory calls for an explanation less than that of regional or local melodies do finally it is necessary to check whether observations concerning the dissemination of melodies indicate some trends or whether it is possible to grasp the character of the source group on the discussion on the basis of them at least in this repertory formulated in another way is any kind of orientation palpable in the analyzed source group now let's take a look at concrete observations in the order of the dissemination of melodies the comparative tables in example two show the content of the sources according to ten on Mars right now oneบ genre first Kyria melodies and after that Gloria and so on on the basis of this information I have prepared a table with a grouping of melodies example 3 in\nthe first group in example 3 I placed melodies that are documented in the catalogues from one source alone the Sanctus melody 189 is an exception since it occurs in three sources but all from Cividale although as concrete examples we can regard this Einzelmelodien as characteristic of the area or source group under discussion their number doesn't differ from the average of such melodies in other areas for example concerning Italy Schildbach registers 26 such melodies from the 11th up to the 18th century in the comparative tables I have marked the Einzelmelodien together with the melodies known only from Italian sources as underlined as you can see in example 2 in the second group of example 3 back to the example 3 I have collected melodies that were used all over Europe through the centuries and which according to my information became integral elements of the Aquileian tradition as well those well-known melodies that occur only exceptionally in Aquileia are placed in the next row of this table the regional melodies are undoubtedly more interesting than those of the above mentioned groups the next row of the table is the original melodies which are the most popular in the region and the next two categories were not arbitrarily created but took shape almost automatically on the basis of collected information on the distribution of the melodies in the sources of Aquileia we find a remarkably great number of melodies that were disseminated mainly in German and Central European manuscripts in the comparative tables these are indicated in bold letters and they are the most popular in the European and European manuscripts in the comparative tables this observation seems to be of even greater importance by the fact that besides the German and Ostland ish sources using the term of the catalogues they occur mostly or exclusively in Aquileia and codices so not in other Italian manuscripts on the basis of their dissemination in Italian sources the items of this group can be differentiated further as can be seen in example for among these German oriented melodies we find only one that proves to be widely disseminated in Italian regions beyond numerous North Italian sources this Kyrian number 151 occurs in Beneventan manuscripts as well it is striking that beside the overall similarity in their orientation the sources from Aquileia and Cividale do not agree with each other in every respect for example while the Gloria number 48 occurs only in sources from Cividale the Kyrian melodies number 144 or number 74 can be exclusively documented from Aquileian sources\nCamillo Oswald emphasizes in the above-mentioned monograph that decked is ik this is the\nand that although the diocesan repertoire is delivered in unison but not in all points\nThe observations in the ordinary repertory, which will be summarized later on, agree with these formulations.\nThough in the Aquileia and Kyriale the general and central European melodies represent the majority in the presence of a few other melodies,\ndifferent influence reveals itself the fifth row of the third example contains\nmelodies the dissemination of which can be regarded as the inverse of that of the previous group while they are generally unknown or at least exceptional in German sources apart from more or less Italian manuscripts they are well represented among French and sometimes English and Sicilian sources these are indicated in italic lettering in the comparative tables it is remarkable that inside my Aquileian source group these appear exceptionally in a source that was categorized as Benedictine in the catalogs this is that Berlin\nand\nAnd since yesterday, I know that this is a source from San Marco, which I was not aware of before.\nThis testifies the usefulness of such conferences. Consequently, the appearance of these pieces has something to do with the special character of this manuscript. All the more so, since the ordinary repertory of this source has little in common with that of the other Aquileian sources, except the well-known melodies from the European basic repertory. Though I had no opportunity to analyze the complete source, the question arises hypothetically whether this source can be counted among the Aquileian sources and whether the J.D. definition, italianisch-deutsch-friaulich, used by Tannabaur and Schildbach, is true. Is Tannabaur or not?\nnow let us examine in detail the relationship between the aquileian sources in the narrow sense and the sources from on the basis of the comparative tables we can declare that at least the kyrie and gloria melodies offer sufficient reference points which show a close relationship between the sources of the two chapters see example v V the light of these observations we can interpret the differences and inconsistencies of the sanctus or agnus dei repertories as capriciousness in recording the melodies for example in the case of the strikingly rich repertory of the source , we cannot simply decide whether we are faced with an great It's a great shock, perhaps.\nUh,\nSo in connection with this source, we cannot simply decide whether we are faced with an additional extra material in the source or a missing portion of the repertory in the case of the other sources. In any case, the majority of these extra melodies give evidence of the above-mentioned German orientation as well. Perhaps the most notable observation is that the German Ostländisch or Ostfrankisch, I would say, orientation reveals itself on a more general level than that of the inner differentiation of the diocese. Such melodies prevail not only in the common stock of melodies, but among the local ones too. So in the melodies. Melodies were in Europe. They were used either only in Aquileia or only in Cividale. Formulated in another way, the source groups of Aquileia, in the narrow sense, and Cividale reveal a German-Central European orientation also independently of each other. It is frequently emphasized in the literature that besides indications of a connection between Aquileia and the neighboring Italian regions, the influence of the northern areas can be strongly felt. This may be attributed to several factors, the listing of which would exceed the limits of this paper. Suffice it to mention the intercultural position of this area, the fact that between the 11th and 13th centuries all patriarchs were of German origin or the influence of the Italian monasteries founded from here-so, etc. The many experiences referring to this influence served as a basis for the views of the local people, that research should concentrate on an identification of evidence of this German influence rather than the definition of an independent and, to a certain extent, imaginary Aquileian liturgy. In any case, an examination of the ordinary repertory of Aquileia coincides with these observations.\nA comparative analysis of the Kyriale repertories of the sources raises another critical question. After the rough designation system used by Melnicki and Bosse for the sources, Schildbach introduced further differentiation by which he wished to reflect the intercultural character of some sources. He applied it to only two sources, the Berlin source and the Udine, mentioned above, the designation JD, Italienisch-Deutsch-Friaulich. Schildbach extended it over one more source as well. This is a source...\nAmnesia, 125.\nActually, at least on the basis of my experiences in the Kyrielle repertory, there is no reason not to designate similarly the other sources from Aquileia and Cividale used in the catalogues. Moreover, it is the source from San Marco mentioned above, the labelling of which might raise doubts. The claim arises naturally that we should check the former observations by comparing the Aquileian sources with carefully selected Italian sources from the neighbouring or possibly more remote regions. For this reason, I have made further analysis in the following source group, see example 6. The first of the two subgroups, which I separated in the following, in the following comparative tables too, contains north Italian, while the other has rather central Italian sources. Of course, in the arbitrariness, or one might say haphazardness in the selection of sources, a certain danger is concealed. Nevertheless, on the basis of a relatively large number of instances, the characteristic points reveal themselves and confirm the relative independence of the source group. Some of these characteristic points connect to a wide circle of Italian sources to each other, while others serve as a basis for further differentiation. And what is more important, the similarities and differences can be interpreted along the same trends as those we established in the Aquileian repertory, that is, the somewhat abstract, and hypothetical methodological categories concerning the orientation of sources prove to be useful here as well. In the comparative tables, I use the same methods for the differentiation of the Einzelmelodien, the Italian, the German or French Italian-oriented melodies, see example 7.\nOh, perhaps they are not in the proper order, first comes example 8 and then example 7.\nNever mind.\nThe number of the Einzelmelodien doesn't differ from general experience, though there are significant differences between the individual sources in this respect. For example, one of the Piacenza sources\nThis this one is the number 65\nexcels the others with its nine such melodies. Where the widespread European repertory is concerned, we find here largely the same items from it as in Aquileia. However, the situation is completely different in the cases of the Italian and regionally disseminated ordinary melodies. I discuss them respectively.\nSee again example or see now example\nIt is striking that the melodies sometimes well represented, though not equally, in north and central Italian sources were not in use in Aquileia at all. The one exception is the Kyrie melody number 31, which besides the source from San Marco can also be documented from Monza, Benevent, Monte Cassino and Nursia as well. The number of the so-called German-oriented melodies is remarkably less than was in Aquileia. This is more significant in the light of the dissemination, since here such melodies occur sporadically here and there. An exception is the Gloria 19, which on the other hand is missing from Aquileian sources, though this is also a German-oriented melody, well-known in Europe. The high number of melodies hypothetically called West Frankish is completely in harmony with this observation. Although some of them can be documented from one or a few sources, which may be a consequence of the random selection of the sources, others show themselves significantly characteristic of the non-Aquileian Italian codices. I have marked them with an asterisk in the third row of example 8. I have marked them with an asterisk in the third row of example 8.\nthese significant points cannot be connected to any narrower circle of sources though for drawing such conclusions the number of the analyzed sources is by no means sufficient however as a by-product of my statistics i call attention to the almost complete agreement of the chiriale repertory in arezzo and siena what we have said about the ostfrancish orientation in the aquileian repertory is also valid here for the opposite reason both the well-documented and the sparsely represented melodies confirm the picture of a radical shift towards a quasi-westfrancish orientation finally on the basis of the chiriale repertory the characteristic difference between the north and south of central italian sources is less than that between the aquileian and non-aquileian repertories\nsome methodological considerations\nmy categorization defining one group of the melodies as ostfrancish and the other as westfrancish may arouse questions or objections though i have simply used them as an aid for orientation i held it important to check these notions as to the validity of them namely i was wondering how my melodies and groups are represented in david hiley's ordinary catalog which is based on 77 english north french and sicilian manuscripts so a markedly western source group the result is more than convincing while the overwhelming majority of my my westfrancish melodies are present in it and occur frequently in its all three groups the overwhelming majority of those defined by me as german or and central european are missing from it exceptions are the kyrie 144 and 151 or the gloria number 25 which apart from the high number of the german documents can be found in hiley's english french and sicilian sources as well nevertheless in accordance with the overall picture emerging from all collected information i left them in the german group in any case these would would by no by no means modify the plausible proportion of the statistics shown in example 9. some closing remarks\nit is perhaps unusual when concerning the observations and conclusions of an examination the author himself warns the audience i emphasized in advance that the method used in this paper might be risky to a certain extent the retrieval of the information from the catalog itself and the quasi reconstruction of virtual sources by deduction is problematic Already the material the analysis focused on is not beyond doubt reliable and, what is more important, it is only to a very limited extent suitable for analyzing the melodies in their real context. And the evaluation of the sources requires several aspects other than the mere occurrence or absence of a certain melody. For example, my own research proved that distribution of the Curiale melodies in the sources, the assignment of them to certain feasts, the pairing of them, the compilation of cycles from them, and, last but not least, the actual variance of the melodies, all together outline a physiognomy of repertory that could be characteristic of a diocese or a consuetudo.\nThe other aspect I neglected here to associate with this study is the distribution of the melodies. The most important aspect to a certain extent is the chronology. As Camillo Oswald, among others, emphasizes, there is a not negligible difference between the 12th and 15th century state of the Aquileian tradition. Among my observations there may be cases where the differences are the consequences of chronological rather than geographical or institutional distance of the sources. However, the variables presented in the foregoing reveal the character of the Aquileian ordinary repertory, show its significant points, and are quite promising as to make the picture more accurate and convincing later on by examining the other aspects mentioned above. Thank you very much.\nI am afraid that when we encounter such a huge material, we cannot give any remark as to the single items or single ordinary pieces, but I suppose that in a methodological sense you will have some questions and additions.\nIn the Liber Ordinarios, Ecclesiae Paduae, is cited a sanctus qui dicitur Franciscus, only with this definition. Might you tell me if you have ever found such an item, or if you have any suggestions for my research?\nYou have Francisco.\nFrancisco.\nFrancisco.\nFrancisco.\nFrancisco. Francisco. So not French, but the name.\nIt means, we think, in this case, that it's a sanctus that comes from France.\nI have never met such designation at all and concerning Italian sources, I have mentioned that I had no opportunity to analyze the actual melodies and the designations and the rubrics. My information mainly comes from the published catalogues.\nHave you any suggestions for me?\ncurious. Very curious. Comments are sometimes given, added to the ordinary. For example, we have in one Hungarian, Kyrie kiskápolna, that is the little chapel Kyrie, and others.\nAnd also names.\narv\nTrattandosi di canti dell'ordinario, potrebbe essere utile distinguere nella diffusione, trasmissione di questi canti, la presenza o meno di tropi? Perché penso che a volte più che il canto dell'ordinario abbia avuto interesse un tropo.\nThe catalogues registered also tropes, but at this phase of my research I didn't deal with them. But later on, perhaps it would be necessary and useful. In general, I dealt with tropes\nNot frequently, because in the Hungarian repertory these are almost completely missing.\nOther questions? Remarks?\nSpeaking about the ordinary tropes, they are surprising less in Aquileia, according to Raffaella Camillot Oswald catalogue. So I would like to ask some of you, if you have some suggestions, why? They are really, comparing with the repertory of the Austrian region, they are really very, very few pieces.\nHave any of you experiences in this field, with Aquileia sources and tropes, ordinary tropes?\nI ask myself, statistically, is it correct to include Berlin or 5000 tropes? Yes.\nIn this case, I want to apologize. I'm too tired. I go on, if I may, in English. I may excuse ourselves that all the results of the trope volume aren't yet published. But I mean, one of the main results, and Andreas made it very clear, in his study on some late Aquileian stuff at the beginning of our session, is that the whole concept of Aquileia, to take it as a unit, is extremely problematic. I think we only can speak about Aquileia in a general sense, and then we have to divide, and these are things, aspects that are, have been shown with and so on. And of course, the Venice cat girl.\nThe same, the same, for the same.\nYeah, of course, of course. I mean, we have really to divide it up, and as soon as we begin to draw consequences of such groupings, I think we really have to make sure what is the basic material on which we work. So to add another small remark to it, I mean, if we, it's like hardware space, as soon as you begin to take the whole transmission into account, first assumptions and consequences that you draw from looking to one or two or three sources become relative. Of course, this is the same picture if you work on certain pieces and pieces of the work. Of course, the tropes of ordinary pieces have to be taken into account, and you just speak about an Italian situation which shows up outside from Bacchilea with interesting but very specific selection of sources. As soon as you fill up the picture, more and more and more, and there, of course, is an enormous amount of manuscript. And you get the temporal and the geographical aspects and to take them into account. The main line that there are some pieces that have in their transmission a basic appearance in the Eastern and some that have a basic experience in the Western situation, and that in Italy we meet such, these ones, and other ones. It comes out always. But for the rest, I think we have to nail things down to complete source material under control.\nPerhaps in this case, this is a little special situation because of these catalogs are given, which offers a kind of wider selection of the sources, that one have individual access to, perhaps. And of course, it's like a warning to offer each other such catalogs in the possible wider horizon. So I think we can take a pause.\n15 minutes.\nEsce fuori della tradizione.\nOnly a bit, sir. Only a bit."
