        "abstract": "The study examines the ordinary repertory of Aquileia and Cividale, highlighting the German-Central European orientation of these sources, which contrasts with other Italian regions. Through comparative analysis, the research identifies unique melodies and trends, emphasizing the intercultural influences and the need for cautious interpretation due to limitations in available data. The findings suggest a distinct character for the Aquileian sources, influenced by historical and geographical factors, and propose further examination of the repertory's chronology and context to enhance understanding.",

For this reason I undertake now to give an overall picture of a special repertory, the ordinary repertory, in a special source group, the sources from Aquileia and Cividale. Aiming at fitting the conference theme, I do this despite that in the collection of the information I was compelled to accept compromises. Since few sources were available on microfilm, I decided to supplement my data bank with information gathered from the published ordinary catalogues. Since it is well known that these are by no means correct in every respect, my collected information and the conclusion based on it must be considered cautiously. It is also known that these catalogues are not suitable for the examination of several aspects. Thus, I have already explained the importance of these catalogues and the importance of the analysis of them. I have only drawn conclusions beyond the occurrence and or absence of certain melodies, only where these seem to be sufficiently convincing. Though experimental in nature, the following overview supplements usefully and harmonizes well with our knowledge about the consuetudo Aquileiensis. For a survey of the ordinary repertory of Aquileia, I used a coherent source group which can be seen in your handout. Example 1. After cataloguing all ordinary melodies in them, I analyzed what kind of melodies the repertories are compiled from and how they can be grouped, which melodies are Einzelmelodien, if there are any examples at all, and which appear more frequently in the sources. The latter requires further differentiation, for it is by no means indifferent what brought the repertory to the original code behind the individual melodies belonging to this group. The appearance of the general European repertory calls for an explanation less than that of regional or local melodies do. Finally, it is necessary to check whether observations concerning the dissemination of melodies indicate some trends, or whether it is possible to grasp the character of the source group under discussion on the basis of them, at least in this repertory. Formulated in another way, is any kind of orientation palpable in the analyzed source group? Now, let's take a look at concrete observations in the order of the dissemination of melodies. The comparative tables in example 2 show the content of the source group. In this case, I have placed the sources according to genre. On the basis of this information, I have prepared a table with a grouping of melodies. In example 3, I placed melodies that are documented in the catalogues from one source alone. The sanctus melody 189 is an exception since it occurs in three sources, but all from Cividale. Although, as concrete examples, we can regard this Einzelmelodien as characteristic of the area or source group under discussion, their number doesn't differ from the average of such melodies in other areas. For example, concerning Italy, Schildbach registers 26 such melodies from the 11th up to the 18th century. In the comparative tables, I have marked the Einzelmelodien together with the melodies known only from Italian sources as underlined, as you can see in example 2.",

The next two categories were not arbitrarily created but took shape almost automatically on the basis of collected information on the distribution of the melodies. In the sources of Aquileia we find a remarkably great number of melodies that were disseminated mainly in German and Central European manuscripts. In the comparative tables these are indicated in bold lettering. This observation seems to be of even greater importance by the fact that besides the German and Ostlandish sources using the term of the catalogues they occur mostly or exclusively in Aquileia and codices.",

Beyond numerous north Italian sources, this Kyrian number 151 occurs in Beneventan manuscripts as well. It is striking that beside the overall similarity in their orientation, the sources from Aquileia and Cividale do not agree with each other in every respect. For example, while the Gloria number 48 occurs only in sources from Cividale, the Kyrian melodies number 144 or number 74 can be exclusively documented from Aquileia.",

          "text": "Perhaps the most notable observation is that the German Ostländisch or Ostfrankisch, I would say, orientation reveals itself on a more general level than that of the inner differentiation of the diocese. Such melodies prevail not only in the common stock of melodies, but among the local ones too. So, the melodies were in use either only in Aquileia or only in Cividale. Formulated in another way, the source groups of Aquileia, in the narrow sense, and Cividale reveal a German-Central European orientation also independently of each other. It is frequently emphasized in the literature that besides indications of a connection between Aquileia and the neighboring Italias, the influence of the northern areas can be strongly felt. This may be attributed to several factors, the listing of which would exceed the limits of this paper. Suffice it to mention the intercultural position of this area, the fact that between the 11th and 13th centuries all patriarchs were of German origin, or the influence of the Italian monasteries founded from here-so, etc. The many experiences referring to this, served as a basis for the view that research should concentrate on an identification of evidence of this German influence, rather than the definition of an independent and, to a certain extent, imaginary Aquileian liturgy. In any case, an examination of the ordinary repertory of Aquileia coincides with these observations.",

He applied to only two sources, the Berlin source and the Udine mentioned above, the designation JD. Italienisch, Deutsch, Friaulich. Schildbach extended it over one more source as well. This is a source from Venetia.",

For this reason I have made further analysis in the following source group, see example 6. The first of the two subgroups, which I separated in the following comparative tables too, contains north Italian, while the other has rather central Italian sources. Of course, in the arbitrariness, or one might say haphazardness in the selection of sources, a certain danger is concealed. Nevertheless, on the basis of a relatively large number of instances, the characteristic points reveal themselves and confirm the relative independence of the Aquileian source group. Some of these characteristic points connect to a wide circle of Italian sources to each other, while others serve as a basis for further differentiation. And what is more important, the similarities and differences can be interpreted along the same trends as those we established in the Aquileian repertory, that is, the somewhat abstract and hypothetical methodological categories concerning the orientation of sources prove to be useful here as well. In the comparative tables I use the same methods for the differentiation of the Einzelmelodien, the Italian, the German or French Italian-oriented melodies. See example 7.",

      "plain-text": "differ from each other at the same time any consideration from the absence of a melody the argumentum excellentio can be used to a lesser extent than in other repertories otherwise it could be interpreted with difficulty that the actually recorded ordinary repertory of sources belonging to the same tradition and being almost identical concerning their liturgical stock may differ so much in their content and quantity however my own comparative research in the field confirms the experience formulated partly by others as well that a rich enough material and interpretation differentiated properly offer significant points that can be usefully supplement the experience gained in other laboratories and may contribute to the definition of the character of a source group. For this reason I undertake now to give an overall picture of a special repertory, the ordinary repertory, in a special source group, the sources from Aquileia and Cividale. Aiming at fitting the conference theme, I do this despite that in the collection of the information I was compelled to accept compromises. Since few sources were available on microfilm, I decided to supplement my data bank with information gathered from the published ordinary catalogues. Since it is well known that these are by no means correct in every respect, my collected information and the conclusion based on it must be considered cautiously. It is also known that these catalogues are not suitable for the examination of several aspects. Thus, I have already explained the importance of these catalogues and the importance of the analysis of them. I have only drawn conclusions beyond the occurrence and or absence of certain melodies, only where these seem to be sufficiently convincing. Though experimental in nature, the following overview supplements usefully and harmonizes well with our knowledge about the consuetudo Aquileiensis. For a survey of the ordinary repertory of Aquileia, I used a coherent source group which can be seen in your handout. Example 1. After cataloguing all ordinary melodies in them, I analyzed what kind of melodies the repertories are compiled from and how they can be grouped, which melodies are Einzelmelodien, if there are any examples at all, and which appear more frequently in the sources. The latter requires further differentiation, for it is by no means indifferent what brought the repertory to the original code behind the individual melodies belonging to this group. The appearance of the general European repertory calls for an explanation less than that of regional or local melodies do. Finally, it is necessary to check whether observations concerning the dissemination of melodies indicate some trends, or whether it is possible to grasp the character of the source group under discussion on the basis of them, at least in this repertory. Formulated in another way, is any kind of orientation palpable in the analyzed source group? Now, let's take a look at concrete observations in the order of the dissemination of melodies. The comparative tables in example 2 show the content of the source group. In this case, I have placed the sources according to genre. On the basis of this information, I have prepared a table with a grouping of melodies. In example 3, I placed melodies that are documented in the catalogues from one source alone. The sanctus melody 189 is an exception since it occurs in three sources, but all from Cividale. Although, as concrete examples, we can regard this Einzelmelodien as characteristic of the area or source group under discussion, their number doesn't differ from the average of such melodies in other areas. For example, concerning Italy, Schildbach registers 26 such melodies from the 11th up to the 18th century. In the comparative tables, I have marked the Einzelmelodien together with the melodies known only from Italian sources as underlined, as you can see in example 2.\nIn the second group of example 3, I have collected melodies that were used all over Europe through the centuries and which, according to my information, became integral elements of the Aquileian tradition as well. Those well-known melodies that occur only exceptionally in Aquileia are placed in the next row of this table.\nThe original melodies are undoubtedly more interesting than those of the above-mentioned groups. The next two categories were not arbitrarily created but took shape almost automatically on the basis of collected information on the distribution of the melodies. In the sources of Aquileia we find a remarkably great number of melodies that were disseminated mainly in German and Central European manuscripts. In the comparative tables these are indicated in bold lettering. This observation seems to be of even greater importance by the fact that besides the German and Ostlandish sources using the term of the catalogues they occur mostly or exclusively in Aquileia and codices.\nSo, not in other Italian manuscripts. On the basis of their dissemination in Italian sources the items of this group can be differentiated further as can be seen in example 4.\nAmong these German-oriented melodies, we find only one that proves to be widely disseminated in Italian regions. Beyond numerous north Italian sources, this Kyrian number 151 occurs in Beneventan manuscripts as well. It is striking that beside the overall similarity in their orientation, the sources from Aquileia and Cividale do not agree with each other in every respect. For example, while the Gloria number 48 occurs only in sources from Cividale, the Kyrian melodies number 144 or number 74 can be exclusively documented from Aquileia.\nCamilo Oswald emphasizes in the above-mentioned monograph that deckt sich der Bestand von Aquileia nicht vorkommen mit dem von Civitale and that although das Diocesan repertoire einheitlich überliefert ist, but nicht in allen Punkten übereinstimmend. The observations in the ordinary repertory, which will be summarized later on, agree with this formulation.\nThough in the Aquileian Kyriale the general and central European melodies represent the majority in the presence of a few other melodies, a different influence reveals itself. The fifth row of the third example\ncontains melodies the dissemination of which can be regarded as the inverse of that of the previous group while they are generally unknown or at least exceptional in German sources apart from more or less Italian manuscripts they are well represented among French and sometimes English and Sicilian sources these are indicated in italic lettering in the comparative table\nIt is remarkable that inside my Aquileian source group these appear exceptionally in a source that was categorized as Benedictine in the catalogues, this is that Berlin source.\nand\nSince yesterday I know that this is a source from San Marco which I was not aware of before.\nthis testifies the usefulness of such conferences consequently the appearance of these pieces has something to do with the special character of this manuscript all the more so since the ordinary repertory of this source has little in common with that of the other aquileian sources except the well-known melodies from the european basic repertory though i had no opportunity to analyze the complete source the question arises hypothetically whether this source can be counted among the aquileian sources and whether the j d definition italianisch deutsch frihaulisch used by tannabaur and schildbach is tenable or not\nNow, let us examine in detail the relationship between the Aquileian sources in the narrow sense and the sources from Cividale. On the basis of the comparative tables, we can declare that at least the Kyrie and Gloria melodies offer sufficient reference points, which show a close relationship between the sources of the two chapters. See example 5.\nIn the light of these observations, we can interpret the differences and inconsistencies of the Sanctus or Agnus Dei repertories as capriciousness in the recording of the melodies. For example, in the case of the strikingly rich repertory of the source, Udine, 93, see example 2,\nwe cannot simply decide whether we are faced with a great shock.\nUh,\nSo in connection with this source, we cannot simply decide whether we are faced with an additional extra material in the source or a missing portion of the repertory in the case of the other sources. In any case, the majority of these extra melodies give evidence of the above-mentioned German orientation as well.\nPerhaps the most notable observation is that the German Ostländisch or Ostfrankisch, I would say, orientation reveals itself on a more general level than that of the inner differentiation of the diocese. Such melodies prevail not only in the common stock of melodies, but among the local ones too. So, the melodies were in use either only in Aquileia or only in Cividale. Formulated in another way, the source groups of Aquileia, in the narrow sense, and Cividale reveal a German-Central European orientation also independently of each other. It is frequently emphasized in the literature that besides indications of a connection between Aquileia and the neighboring Italias, the influence of the northern areas can be strongly felt. This may be attributed to several factors, the listing of which would exceed the limits of this paper. Suffice it to mention the intercultural position of this area, the fact that between the 11th and 13th centuries all patriarchs were of German origin, or the influence of the Italian monasteries founded from here-so, etc. The many experiences referring to this, served as a basis for the view that research should concentrate on an identification of evidence of this German influence, rather than the definition of an independent and, to a certain extent, imaginary Aquileian liturgy. In any case, an examination of the ordinary repertory of Aquileia coincides with these observations.\nA comparative analysis of the Cividale repertory, of the sources, raises another critical question. After the rough designation system used by Melnicki and Bosse for the sources, Schildbach introduced further differentiation by which he wished to reflect the intercultural character of some sources. He applied to only two sources, the Berlin source and the Udine mentioned above, the designation JD. Italienisch, Deutsch, Friaulich. Schildbach extended it over one more source as well. This is a source from Venetia.\nActually, at least on the basis of my experiences in the Kyrielle repertory, there is no reason not to designate similarly the other sources from Aquileia and Cividale used in the catalogues. Moreover it is the source from San Marco mentioned above, the labeling of which might raise the Thank you\nThe claim arises naturally that we should check the former observations by comparing the Aquileian sources with carefully selected Italian sources from the neighbouring or possibly more remote regions. For this reason I have made further analysis in the following source group, see example 6. The first of the two subgroups, which I separated in the following comparative tables too, contains north Italian, while the other has rather central Italian sources. Of course, in the arbitrariness, or one might say haphazardness in the selection of sources, a certain danger is concealed. Nevertheless, on the basis of a relatively large number of instances, the characteristic points reveal themselves and confirm the relative independence of the Aquileian source group. Some of these characteristic points connect to a wide circle of Italian sources to each other, while others serve as a basis for further differentiation. And what is more important, the similarities and differences can be interpreted along the same trends as those we established in the Aquileian repertory, that is, the somewhat abstract and hypothetical methodological categories concerning the orientation of sources prove to be useful here as well. In the comparative tables I use the same methods for the differentiation of the Einzelmelodien, the Italian, the German or French Italian-oriented melodies. See example 7.\nThey are not in the proper order. First comes example 8 and then example 7. Never mind.\nThe number of the Einzelmelodien doesn't differ from general experience, though there are significant differences between the individual sources in this respect. For example, one of the Piacenza\nThis this one is the\nNo. 65 excels the others with its nine such melodies. Where the widespread European repertory is concerned, we find here largely the same items from it as in Aquileia. However, the situation is completely different in the cases of the Italian and regionally disseminated\nmelodies. I discussed them respectively.\nIt is striking that the melodies sometimes well represented, though not equally, in North and Central Italian sources were not in use in Aquileia at all. The one exception is the Kyrie melody No. 31, which beside the\nsource from San Marco,\ncan also be documented from Monza, Benevent, Monte Cassino and Nurzia as well. The number of the so-called German-oriented melodies is remarkably less than was in Aquileia. This is more significant in the light of the dissemination, since here such melodies occur sporadically here and there. An exception is the Gloria XIX, which on the other hand is missing from Aquileian sources, though this is also a German-oriented melody, well known in Central Europe and Italy.\nThe high number of melodies hypothetically called West Frankish is completely in harmony with this observation. Although some of them can be documented from one or a few sources, which may be a consequence of the random selection of the sources, others show themselves significantly characteristic of the non-Aquileian Italian codices. I have marked them with an asterisk in the third row of example 8.\nthese significant points cannot be connected to any narrower circle of sources though for drawing such conclusions the number of the analyzed sources is by no means sufficient however as a by-product of my statistics i call attention to the almost complete agreement of the chiriale repertory in arezzo and siena what we have said about the ostfrankish orientation in the aquileian repertory is also valid here for the opposite reason\ndocumented and sparsely represented melodies confirm the picture of a radical shift towards a quasi West Frankish orientation. Finally, on the basis of the Kyriale repertory, the characteristic difference between the north and central Italian sources is less than that between the Aquileian and non-Aquileian repertories. Some methodological considerations\nmy categorization defining one group of the melodies as ostfrankisch and the other as westfrankisch may arouse questions or objections though i have simply used them as an aid for orientation i held it important to check these notions as to the validity of them namely i was wondering how my melodies and groups are represented in david hiley's ordinary catalogue which is based on 77 english north french and sicilian manuscripts so a markedly western source group the result is more than convincing while the overwhelming majority of my my westfrankisch melodies are present in the catalogue i was wondering how my melodies and groups are represented in david hiley's ordinary catalogue which is based on 77 english north french and sicilian manuscripts in it and occur frequently in its all three groups the overwhelming majority of those defined by me as german or and central european are missing from it exceptions are the kyrie 144 and 151 or the gloria number 25 which apart from the high number of german documents can be found in hiley's english french and sicilian manuscripts and sicilian sources as well nevertheless in accordance with the overall picture emerging from all collected information i left them in the german group in any case these would would by no by no means modify the plausible proportion of the statistics shown in example nine some closing remarks it is perhaps unusual when concerning the observations and conclusions of an examination the author himself warned the audience i emphasize the inner the ones that the methods used in this paper might be risky to a certain extent already the retrieval of the information from the catalogs itself and d quasi reconstruction of virtual sources by deduction is problematic over the the material the analysis focused on is not to be on the doubt reliable and what is more important\nsuitable for analyzing the melodies in their real context and the evaluation of the sources requires several aspects other than the mere occurrence or absence of a certain melody. For example my own research proved that distribution of the Curiale melodies in the sources, the assignment of them to certain feasts, the pairing of them, the compilation of cycles from them,\nand last but not least the actual variance of the melodies\naltogether outline a physiognomy of repertory that could be characteristic of a diocese or a consuetud.\nthe other aspect i neglected here to a certain extent is the chronology as camillo oswald among others emphasizes there is a not negligible difference between the twelfth and fourteenth and fifteenth century state of the aquileian tradition among my observations there may be cases where the differences are the consequences of chronological rather than geographical or institutional distance of the sources however the tables presented in the foregoing reveal the character of the aquileian ordinary repertory show its significant points and are quite promising as to make the picture more accurate and convincing later on by examining the other aspects mentioned above thank you very much\nI'm afraid that when we encounter such a huge material, we cannot give any remark as to the single items or single ordinary pieces. But I suppose that in methodological sense, you will have some questions and ideas.\nIn the Liber Ordinarios Ecclesiae Paduanae is cited a Sanctus Quidicitur Franciscus, only with this definition. Might you tell me if you have ever found such an item, or if you have any suggestions for my research?\nYou have a doctor? Franciscus.\nFranciscus. You know, uh...\nFranciscus.\nFranciscus.\nFranciscus.\nFranciscus. So, no French, but the name. It's\nIt means, we think, in this case, that it's a sanctus that comes from France.\nsuch designation at all and concerning Italian sources I I have mentioned that I had no opportunity to to to analyze the actual melodies and the designations and rubrics these are my information mainly come from from the cat published catalogues\nAnd have you any suggestions for me?\nVery curious, very curious comments are sometimes given, added to the ordinary.\nFor example, we have in one Hungarian, Kyrie kiskápolna, that is the little chapel Kyrie, and others, and also names.\ntrattandosi di canti dell'ordinario potrebbe essere utile distinguere nella diffusione trasmissioni questi canti la presenza o meno di troppi perché penso che a volte più che il canto dell'ordinario abbia avuto interesse un troppo\nThe catalogues registered also tropes, but at this phase of my research I didn't deal with them. But later on, perhaps, it would be necessary and useful. In general, I dealt with tropes\nNot frequently, because in the Hungarian repertory these are almost completely mistaken.\nSo questions, remarks?\nSpeaking about the ordinary tropes, it's surprising, they are surprising less in Aquileia according to Raphaela Camillot, Oswald, catalogue. So I would like to ask some of you, if you have some suggestions, why? They are really comparing with the repertory of post-generation\nthere are few pieces very few pieces\nHave any of you experiences in this field with the Aquileia sources and tropes, ordinary tropes?\nMi domando, statisticamente è corretto inserire Berlino 5608 tra i manoscritti di Aquilei?\nIn this case, I'm too tired.\nI go on, if I may, in English. I may excuse ourselves that all the results of the trope volume aren't yet published. But, I mean, one of the main results, and Andreas made it very clear in his study on some late Aquilian stuff at the beginning, of our session, is that the whole concept of Aquileia, to take it as a unit, is extremely problematic. I think we only can speak about Aquileia in a general sense, and then we have to divide, and these are aspects that have been shown with Chividade and so on. And, of course, the Venice category. Yeah.\nfor the same motif.\nI don't know.\nYeah, of course, of course. I mean, we have really to divide it up, and as soon as we begin to draw consequences of such groupings, I think we really have to make sure what is the basic material on which we work. So to add another small remark to it, I mean, if we, it's like hardware space, as soon as you begin to take the whole transmission into account, first assumptions and consequences that you draw from looking to one or two or three sources become relative. Of course, this is the same picture.\nand of course the tropes of ordinary pieces have to be taken into account and you just speak about an Italian situation which shows up outside from Aquileia with interesting but very\nspecific selection of sources if as soon as you fill up the picture more and more\namount of manuscript, and you get the temporal and geographical aspects, take them into account. The main line that there are some pieces that have in their transmission a basic experience in the Eastern and some that have a basic experience in the Western situation, and that in Italy we meet such these ones and otherwise.\nIt comes out always. But for the rest, I think we have to nail things down to complete source material under control.\nPerhaps in this case this is a little special situation because of these catalogues are given which are\na kind of wider selection\nof the sources that one have individual access to perhaps. And of course it's like a warning to offer each other such catalogs in the possible wider horizon. So I think we can take a pause.\nFifteen minutes.\nEsci fuori della tradizione.\non you, baby."
